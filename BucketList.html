                <li>The tulips mostly bloom during the spring season <br> from mid-April to mid-May, in <b>Amsterdam</b>.</li>
                <li>Amsterdam’s annual <b>Tulip Festival</b> brings a kaleidoscope of colors to all corners of the city. From Vondelpark and central Dam Square to the swirling streets of the Museum Quarter, more than 880,000 tulips will bloom in 85 locations around town. </li>
                <li> A one of a kind festival that I think is absolutely worth seeing.</li>

                <p>The 2024 edition will take place throughout April and include locations such as the Plantage Middenlaan near the historic Artis zoo, and NDSM Wharf, a former shipyard, across the IJ river.</p>
                <p>The Keukenhof, a 40-minute drive from downtown Amsterdam, hosts some of the Netherlands’ most dazzling flower displays. With 79 acres bedecked in more than 7 million bulbs</p>
                <p>The pricing for the entrace €19.50 (US$21.50) for adults, €9 (US$10 ) for children</p>

            <h3>Madeira, Portugal</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Arugably the most popular hike on the island, the <b>25 Fontes hike</b> is one of the best things to do on Madeira because it features several gorgeous waterfalls. From the name along the hike you will encounter 25 waterfalls making one beautifull scenery</li>
                <li>See <b>sunset at Pico do Arieiro</b>. Pico do Arieiro is the third highest peak on Madeira, and a must-see viewpoint when the clouds are low enough to form a layer between you and the world below.</li>

                <p> The best part? You can get these incredible views a 60-second walk away from a car park! That makes this an excellent location for people who don’t want to trek. There’s even a stairlift for wheelchair users or people who can’t get up stairs.<br>
                    See <b>the traditional houses at Santana</b>
                    Madeira was claimed by Portuguese sailors in the early 1400s, and was supposedly uninhabited at the time (though there’s evidence the Vikings may have visited a few centuries earlier).

                    Some of the early inhabitants built small, triangular houses with thatched roofs, best observed today at the cultural site called Casas típicas de Santana in the Northeast part of Madeira.

                <li><b>Museo Atlántico</b> Europe’s first underwater sculpture museum, in the sea near Marina Rubicon, features cement figures and sculptures by artist Jason deCaires Taylor, which are slowly being colonised by marine life...</li>

                <p>Lanzarote is famous for scuba diving, but drifting through thought-provoking sculptures 12-metres down is a whole different experience.<br>
                <b> Natural swimming pools</b> Outdoor sea swimming pools can be found around Lanzarote’s southern and eastern coasts, most natural formations in the rocks, with only steps and ladders added. Others are more built structures but with an opening to the sea. </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Topping off at 2,080 feet, the <b>Tokyo Skytree</b> is the tallest tower (that's tower, not building) in the world. From the broadcast tower’s 360-degree observation decks, the whole city—its striking skyscrapers and neon intersections—looks like a magical circuit board. </li>
                <li>Tokyo may not have as many temples as Kyoto, but <b>Senso-ji</b> isn’t the capital city’s most popular just by default. The atmosphere alone here is one for the bucket list. Senso-ji, the temple itself, is at the end of the shopping street....</li>

                <p> Japanese visitors flutter around a large cauldron in front of the temple where incense burned inside is said to benefit good health.<br>
                    <b>Sakurai tea experience</b>, copper and wood greet you inside this minimalist sanctuary dedicated to sado, the Japanese “way of tea.” A small retail space filled with glass jars containing 30 varieties of green tea conceals an intimate eight-seat cafe. Founder Shinya Sakurai studied for 14 years to become a master, and his modern take on tea ceremony is meditative and illuminating.</p>

                <li> <b>Bali Swing and Bali Bird Nest</b> Instead of queueing for the more popular swing near the entrance of the rice fields, take the swing at the Tegalalang Rice Fields for an aerial and panoramic shot of the rice terraces. </li>

            <h3>Seoul, South Coreea</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Bukchon Village</b>occupies the hilly neighborhood between Gyeongbok Palace and Changdeok Palace in north-central Seoul. The neighborhood has the largest collection of privately owned hanoks, or traditional Korean homes with tiled roofs and stone floors, in Seoul. Not only that, but these 900 hanoks date all the way back to the Joseon Dynasty</li>
                <li>Located in northern Seoul – but still quite accessible via public transportation – <b>Bukhansan National Park</b> is a mountainous oasis in a bustling metropolis. The park, which covers more than 30 square miles, is home to towering granite peaks, forest-laden valleys and miles of hiking trails in between, as well as about 100 historic Buddhist temples and monks' cells.</li>

               <p> <b>Changdeokgung</b> may not be the oldest or largest of Seoul's five Joseon Dynasty palaces (that honor goes to Gyeongbokgung), but it is the most intact. <br>
                Originally constructed in 1405 as a secondary palace for the king at the time, Changdeokgung, like its sister palaces, was largely razed during the Japanese invasion of 1592.<br>
                 After its reconstruction in 1610, however, the palace served as Korea's principal palace about 270 years after for 13 different kings. </p>
